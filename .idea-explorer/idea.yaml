  title: Do LLMs differentiate epistemic belief from non-epistemic belief?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models may or may not differentiate between epistemic
    belief and non-epistemic belief, similar to distinctions observed in human cognition.
    This research aims to determine whether LLMs exhibit different types of beliefs
    analogous to those identified in humans.

    '
  background:
    description: 'Inspired by Vesga et al. that argues humans have different types
      of beliefs, it would be interesting to find out whether LLMs similarly have
      different types of beliefs.
